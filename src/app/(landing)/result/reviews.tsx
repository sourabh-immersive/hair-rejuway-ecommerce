              that is when a friend recommended Traya. I gave it a shot and after 4 months 
              of use, I can definitely say that their holistic approach to treating hair loss 
              with both ayurveda and allopathy just works.`,

    review: `I came to Traya with a bald patch and I did not expect any drastic results. My motive was 
              to stop further hair loss, after dedicatedly following the plan and one can tell how it 
              has changed my hair. I have baby hair all over my scalp and thicker growth. 
              This is a dream, thank you guys you are the best!`,
